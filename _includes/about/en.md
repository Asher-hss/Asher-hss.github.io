Hey, this is Huang Shengsong(Asher). I majored in Applied Physics at a university in Shanghai for my undergraduate studies. Out of interest, I have self-studied some microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, and statistics, and actively participated in study exchange activities with the Bear Group.

Recently, I've been pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. I've learned a bit about machine learning and deep learning, and in my free time, I've participated in study exchange activities with Datawhale, a Chinese AI open-source organization, keen on sharing my learning records. To pursue a career as a software development engineer, I am attempting to develop a project using technologies such as Spring Boot and React.

Currently, I spend most of my time on the -1st floor of the Leavey Library at USC and in my home's kitchen (I'll become a chef if I can't find a job). Besides technology, I enjoy traveling, cooking, gaming, reading, and occasionally engaging in fitness activities. I've previously tried figure skating and Locking, and recently, I've been itching to try skiing.
